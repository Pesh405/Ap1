At the same time, the chain in the Block 8 is in the same column with A6. The Cell A5 is intersection in chain of the Cell A2 and the Row H. So we can delete the candidate number 2 in H2. 
 If two lines (e.g., a row and a column) cover all possible places for a given digit in some box, then that digit cannot occur on both lines outside that box, since that would not leave any place for the digit inside the box."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_hidden_pair">"In the Row H, the candidate number 6 &amp; 8 only appear in Cell H1 &amp; Cell H2, so we can delete other candidate numbers in these two cells. 
 All Hidden Subsets work the same way, the only thing that changes is the number of cells and candidates affected by the move. Take Hidden Pair: If you can find two cells within a house such as that two candidates appear nowhere outside those cells in that house, those two candidates must be placed in the two cells. All other candidates can therefore be eliminated."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_hidden_quadruple">"In the Block 4, the candidate number 5,6,7,8 only appear in Cell D1 &amp; Cell D2 &amp; Cell E1 &amp; Cell E2, so we can delete other candidate numbers in these four cells. 
 Hidden Quadruples (4 candidates in 4 cells) are relatively seldom. It is very hard to spot them without using pencil marks."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_hidden_single">"Candidate number 9, only appears in the Cell C6 in the Block 2, so this cell can only be filled with 9. 
 Hidden Single means that for a given digit and house only one cell is left to place that digit. The cell itself has more than one candidate left, the correct digit is thus hidden amongst the rest."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_hidden_triple">"In the Row G, the candidate number 4,7,8 only appear in Cell G2 &amp; Cell G7 &amp; Cell G9, so we can delete other candidate numbers in these three cells. 
 A hidden triple occurs when three cells in a row, column, or block contain the same three numbers, or a subset of those three. The three cells also contain other candidates."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_intersection_removel">"In the Column 1, the candidate number 6 only appears in the Block 4. So we can delete the candidate number 6 the other cells in Block 4. 
 Intersection removal is a strategy where you can eliminate one candidate from a cell or cells. There are two types of intersection removal: pointing pairs and box/line reduction.You can use Box/Line reduction if a candidate only appears two or three times in a row or column, and those candidates are also all in the same box. When this happens, you know that the candidate MUST occur in that row or column because it can't appear anywhere else there,so it CAN'T occur elsewhere in that box."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_jellyfish">"In the Row A, E, F, G, the candidate number 7 only appears in the Column 2, 4, 5, 9. So we can delete the candidate number 5 in the other cells in the Column 2, 4, 5, 9. 
 Jellyfishes work exactly the same way as X– Wings, just with four base and four cover sets instead of only four."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_last_digit">Here, you can only fill in \"8\".</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_naked_pair">"In the Row D, the cell D1 &amp; D6 contain only 2 candidate numbers 2,9. So we can delete 2,9 in the Cell D4. 
 If you can find two cells, both in the same house,that have only the same two candidates left, you can eliminate that two candidates from all other cells in that house."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_naked_quadruple">"In the Row B, the candidate number 2,3,6,7 only appear in Cell B4 &amp; Cell B5 &amp; Cell B6 &amp; Cell B7, so we can delete 2,3,6,7 in the other cells in the Row B. 
 Hidden Quadruples (4 candidates in 4 cells) are relatively seldom. It is very hard to spot them without using pencil marks."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_naked_single">"In B6, there is only one candidate number 9, so this cell can only be filled with 9. 
 Naked Single means that in a specific cell only one digit remains possible (the last remaining candidate has no other candidates to hide behind and is thus naked). The digit must then go into that cell."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_naked_triple">"In the Row C, the candidate number 2,3,9 only appear in Cell C5 &amp; Cell C6 &amp; Cell C7, so we can delete 2,3,9 in the other cells in the Row C. 
 If you can find three cells, all in the same house, that have only the same three candidates left, you can eliminate that candidates from all other cells in that house. It is important to note that not all cells must contain all three candidates, but there must not be more than three candidates in the three cells all together."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_sky_scraper">"In the Row B, the candidate number 9 only appears in the Cell B7 and B4. In the Row I, the candidate number 9 only appears in the Cell 17 and 16. The Cell B7 and 17 are in the same column, at the same time, The Cell B4 and 16 are not in the same column. The Cell A6 and G4 are intersection in chain of the Cell B4 and 16. So we can delete the candidate number 9 in the Cell A6 and Cell G4. 
 A Skyscraper is a simple pattern that occurs rather often in Sudokus and can be easily spotted. It is nothing really new: A Skyscraper is a special form of Turbot Fish and it can be seen as two Sashimi X–Wings.The description of the pattern sounds more complicated than it really is: Concentrate on one digit. Find two rows (or columns) that contain only two candidates for that digit. If two of those candidates are in the same column (or row), one of the other two candidates must be true. All candidates that see both of those cells can therefore be eliminated."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_swordfish">"In the Row C, F, I, the candidate number 5 only appears in the Column 3, 5, 6. So we can delete the candidate number 5 in the other cells in the Column 3, 5, 6. 
 Swordfishes work exactly the same way as X– Wings, just with three base and three cover sets instead of only two."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_turbot_fish">"In the Block 1, the candidate number 1 only appears in the Cell C1 and Cell A3. In the Row I, the candidate number 1 only appears in the Cell 11 and Cell 15. And the end points C1 and 11 are in the same column. The Cell A5 is intersection in chain of the Cell A3 and 15. So we can delete the candidate number 1 in A5. 
 A Turbot Fish is an X–Chain that is exactly four candidates long. Various shapes can be built with such a chain. One of them resembles a fish, which gave the technique its name (look at the right example: draw two lines from the red candidate to the nearest green and blue candidates to see the fish shape)."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_w_x_y_z_wing">"The candidate numbers of the Cell C1 are W, X,Y, Z(3, 2, 7, 1), the candidate numbers of the Cell B2 are W, Z (3, 1) , the candidate numbers of the Cell C4 are X, Z (2, 1), the candidate numbers of the Cell C1 are Y, Z (7, 1). C1 and B2 are in the same block but in different row, C4 and C7 are in the same row but in different block. So we can delete the number of candidates Z(1) in the intersection of the block where the Cell C1 is located and the row where the Cell C4, C7 is located. 
 A WXYZ–Wing is like an XY–Wing and an XYZ– Wing, except it is a group of four cells, one sharing a unit with the other three. The first cell in a WXYZ–Wing has three or four candidates while the other three, called the wings, have two each. Each of the wings must share one candidate with the first cell, (that's part of sharing a unit) but each wing must share a different value. If the second candidates in the wings are all the same, and are also the same as the leftover candidate of the first cell if the first cell has four candidates, then if any fifth cell shares that candidate and a unit with all the others, that candidate can be eliminated."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_x_wing">"If you exchange the terms rows and columns in the description above, you get an X–Wing in the columns. 
 Take two rows (the base sets). If you can find two columns, such that all candidates of a specific digit (the fish digit) in both rows are containd in the columns (the cover sets), all fish candidates in the columns that are not part of the rows can be eliminated. The result is called an X–Wing in the rows. If you exchange the terms rows and columns in the description above, you get an X– Wing in the columns."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_x_y_chain">"The candidate 4 has a Two–strong–link–multi– digit Chain:F1(4) ==(9)–A1(9)==(7)–C3(7)==3– 13(3)==4 (Starting Point: Green. End Point: Yellow. Strong–link Chain: Solid arrow. Weak link: Dotted line.So we can delete the candidate number 4 in the intersection of F1 and 13. 
 An XY–Chain is a chain that uses only bivalue cells (similar to Remote Pairs), but the cells can have arbitrary candidates. The only restriction (besides the obvious necessities for the links) is, that the XY–Chain starts and ends with a strong link on the same digit. As with X–Chains this proves that one of the endpoints must have that candidate placed, and it can be eliminated from all cells that see both ends of the chain."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_x_y_wing">"Both the candidate X, Y (9, 7) and the candidate Y, Z (7, 4) are in the Block 4. At the same time, they are not in the same row.Both the candidate X, Y (9,7) and the candidate X, Z (9, 4) are in the same row.At the same time, they are not in the same block.So we can delete Z (4) in the intersection of the block where X, Y (9, 7) is located and the line where X, Z (9, 4) is located.And we can also delete Z (4) in the intersection of the block where X, Z (9, 4) is located and the line where Y, Z (7, 4) is located. 
 An XY–Wing is really a short XY–Chain that is described as a pattern and thus can be found more easily. We start by looking for a bivalue cell (the pivot). The possible candidates in that cell are called X and Y. Now we try to find two other cells that see the pivot (the pincers). One of those cells contains candidates X and Z (Z is an arbitrary candidate different from X and Y) and the other candidates Y and Z. Now Z can be eliminated from any cell that sees both pincers."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_x_y_z_wing">"The candidate numbers of the Cell 13 are X, Y,Z(5, 7, 9), the candidate numbers of the Cell H3 are Y, Z (7, 9), the candidate numbers of the Cell 19 are X, Z (5, 9). H3 and 13 are in the same block but in different row, 19 and 13 are in the same row but in different block. So we can delete the number of candidates Z(9) in the intersection of the block where the Cell 13 is located and the row where the Cell 19 is located. 
 The XYZ–Wing is an enhanced version of an XY– Wing: Now the pivot contains not only candidates X and Y but Z as well. Consequently Z can only be eliminated from cells that see not only the pincers, but the pivot as well."</string>
    <string name="skill_desc_y_chain">"The Cells A2 and B5 only contain the candidate number X,Y (1,5) and are not in the same sector. At the same time the candidate number X(1) in Row C only appears in the column of these two cells.So we can delete the candidate number Y (5) in the intersection of A2 and B5. 
 Y–Wing starts with a square that contains exactly two candidates.This square is sometimes called a pivot or hinge.You can use Y–Wing if each of the two candidates in the pivot forms a conjugate pair in two different units. The two end points of the conjugate pairs are sometimes referred to as pincers. However, you can only use Y–Wing if the pincers each contain exactly two numbers, and if one of those two numbers is the same in both pincers. It is this shared number that you might be able to eliminate.Look for squares that both of the pincers can see. If any of these squares contains the shared candidate, you can eliminate that candidate from those squares."</string>

    <string name="x_wing">X–Wing</string>
    <string name="x_wing_desc">If a candidate number can only appear in two cells of a row or column, and these two cells are in the same row or column, and if the same candidate number can also only appear in two cells of another row or column, forming a rectangle with the first two cells, then this is called an X–Wing structure. The candidate number can only appear in the diagonal cells of this rectangle, so the candidate number can be eliminated from other cells in the same row or column as the X–Wing.</string>
    <string name="x_wing_step_1">Look, there are two rows having only &lt;c2>two possible cells&lt;/c2> for &lt;c1>1&lt;/c1> respectively. And they form a rectangle.</string>
    <string name="x_wing_step_2">We can see that either the group of &lt;c3>green 1&lt;/c3> or the group of &lt;c4>red 1&lt;/c4> must be filled in.</string>
    <string name="x_wing_step_3">So either &lt;c2>b5&lt;/c2> or &lt;c2>g5&lt;/c2> must be &lt;c1>1&lt;/c1>, and either &lt;c2>b9&lt;/c2> or &lt;c2>g9&lt;/c2> must be &lt;c1>1&lt;/c1>. Then we can delete &lt;c1>1&lt;/c1> from other cells in these two columns.</string>
    <string name="xy_wing">XY–Wing</string>
    <string name="xy_wing_desc">When three pairs of candidate numbers, consisting of three numbers x, y, and z are formed in three cells, if the xy cell is in the same row, column, or block as the xz and yz cells, then either the xz or yz cell will contain the candidate number z. Therefore the candidate number z can be eliminated from other cells that are controlled by both the xz and yz cells.</string>
    <string name="xy_wing_step_1">Look, there are &lt;c2>two cells&lt;/c2> containing &lt;c1>2&lt;/c1> and &lt;c3>3&lt;/c3>, and &lt;c1>2&lt;/c1>, and &lt;c3>8&lt;/c3>, respectively. They are in the same row, column or box with &lt;c2>the cell&lt;/c2> containing &lt;c3>3&lt;/c3> and &lt;c3>8&lt;/c3>.</string>
    <string name="xy_wing_step_2">If &lt;c2>i9&lt;/c2> is &lt;c3>3&lt;/c3>, &lt;c2>g7&lt;/c2> must be &lt;c1>2&lt;/c1>. lf &lt;c2>i9&lt;/c2> is &lt;c3>8&lt;/c3>, &lt;c2>a9&lt;/c2> must be &lt;c1>2&lt;/c1>. Therefore, either &lt;c2>g7&lt;/c2> or &lt;c2>a9&lt;/c2> must be &lt;c1>2&lt;/c1>.</string>
    <string name="xy_wing_step_3">So &lt;c1>2&lt;/c1> should be deleted from any of the &lt;c1>intersecting cells&lt;/c1> of &lt;c2>g7&lt;/c2> and &lt;c2>a9&lt;/c2>.</string>
    <string name="xyz_wing">XYZ–Wing</string>
    <string name="xyz_wing_desc">Given three numbers x, y, and z, there are three cells that contain the candidate numbers xz, yz, and xyz. When the cell containing xyz is in the same row/column/block as cells containing xz and yz, one of the cells xz, yz, and xyz must contain the candidate number z. Therefore, any other cells controlled by xz, yz, and xyz can eliminate the candidate number z.</string>
    <string name="xyz_wing_step_1">Look, there are &lt;c2>two cells&lt;/c2> containing &lt;c3>9&lt;/c3> and &lt;c1>5&lt;/c1>, and &lt;c3>3&lt;/c3> and &lt;c1>5&lt;/c1> respectively. They are in the same row, column or box with &lt;c2>the cell&lt;/c2> containing &lt;c3>9&lt;/c3>, &lt;c3>3&lt;/c3>, and &lt;c1>5&lt;/c1>.</string>
    <string name="xyz_wing_step_2">&lt;c2>g8&lt;/c2> can only be filled with &lt;c3>9&lt;/c3>, &lt;c3>3&lt;/c3> or &lt;c1>5&lt;/c1>. lf &lt;c2>g8&lt;/c2> is &lt;c3>9&lt;/c3>, &lt;c2>i7&lt;/c2> must be &lt;c1>5&lt;/c1>. lf &lt;c2>g8&lt;/c2> is &lt;c3>3&lt;/c3>, &lt;c2>g6&lt;/c2> must be &lt;c1>5&lt;/c1>. Therefore, at least one of &lt;c2>these three cells&lt;/c2> must be filled with &lt;c1>5&lt;/c1>.</string>
